# MyReads - A Book Tracking App

This project was created using Udacity's MyReads App [Starter Template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## How to install and launch

Download or clone the repo and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

## Components

### Main Page

The main page has three shelves:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

You can move books between these shelves as you choose new books to read and finish reading them.

### Search Page

You can search for new books to read, as the app allows you to search for books by title/author. You can add any books from your search result to your own shelves.
